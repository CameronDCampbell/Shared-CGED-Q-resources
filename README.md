# Resources for users of the CGED-Q JSL Public Release

This is a collection of resources to facilitate use of the CGED-Q JSL Public Releases. It includes code snippets for recoding or otherwise handling unusual cases, tables for recoding/categorization/cleanup of variables, and sample code. 

The materials here are not part of the official data release. Use at your own risk. They may change as we release more data, or as we discover issues. 

All the materials in this repository assume that you have read the *User Guide*, which is available at the download websites linked below. The material here is *not* a substitute for reading the *User Guide*, which has detailed information on the origin and context of each of the variables.   

The CGED-Q JSL Public Releases are a [Lee-Campbell Group project](https://www.shss.ust.hk/lee-campbell-group). Please visit our website to learn more about our projects and research outputs.

# Code for working with the CGED-Q Public Release

[Flag variables](FlagVariables.md)

Flag variables to identify sets of records that are commonly excluded, including records of empty posts, duplicates, and posts that only appear in commercial editions.

Flag variables that identify sets of records associated with particular types of officials, including those serving in the central government, and those who were Bannermen.

[Recoding/recategorizing/cleaning variables](recoding.md)

Code to regroup variables into analytically useful categories (e.g. chushen 出身), clean up the contents of variables (e.g. province of origin, location of post)
